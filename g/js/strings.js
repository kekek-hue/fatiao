As Monarch’s leading early warning specialist, it is his job to turn sound into strategy, by analyzing the sonics of superspecies to predict the behaviors they will enact upon the world. Recording  everything, Stanton catalogs Monarch’s expansive Titan audio forensics database known as “the Ark.”', '1em'],
                    ['As brilliant as he is high-strung, Rick would much prefer to be alone in a lab than in a room full of people that don’t have the necessary perspective to understand his brilliance. He began his career as a communications engineer for SETI before joining Landsat as a satellite mapping technician in the 1980’s, an experience he credits with giving him a “god’s eye view of the world.”', '1em'],
                    ['Becoming increasingly intrigued by company whispers of a covered-up mission to Skull Island in 1973, he reached out to one of the rumored Skull Island project leads, Dr. Houston Brooks, and the two like minds soon became close friends. Brooks introduced him to Dr. Serizawa who knew a true believer when he saw one, and shortly after Stanton was offered a position at Monarch. To most, the idea of Titans sounded like a crazy conspiracy theory. To Stanton, it sounded like a dream job opportunity.', '1em'],
                    ['Dr. Stanton oversaw the Monarch Sciences satellite tracking system until he was offered a field assignment on Monarch’s underwater surveillance team at Castle Bravo and jumped at the opportunity. As a longtime proponent of Dr. Brooks’ Hollow Earth theory, being stationed underwater puts his ear to the wall of what he believes is a vast and unexplored ecosystem deep within the Earth.', '1em'],
                    ['His dedication to his work has put strain on his personal life, and he’s been divorced three times as a result. Said Stanton: “I can measure the distance between sub-aquatic splinter pulses ten miles apart without using a harmonic density amplifier, but I apparently can’t detect a woman’s heartbeat.” He remains married to the insanity of his job, and it’s truly the happiest he’s ever been in a relationship.', '1em']

Her Monarch Field Tutor reports that she is remarkably academically gifted (as expected, given her parentage) although perhaps impatient with structured study programs.
